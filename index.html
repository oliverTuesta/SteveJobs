        <h2>Who was Steve Jobs?</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Steve Jobs was an American business magnate, entrepreneur, investor,
          and writer. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and
          co-founder of Apple Inc.

        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>
          <q cite="https://www.biography.com/business-figure/steve-jobs">
            Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He
            lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California, within
            the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley. As a boy,
            Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul
            showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct electronics, a
            hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity and mechanical prowess in
            young Jobs.</q

            While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his
            youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs was
            a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his
            fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so
            well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high
            school â€” a proposal that his parents declined. After high school,
            Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking
            direction, he dropped out of college after six months and spent the
            next 18 months dropping in on creative classes at the school. Jobs
            later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his love of
            typography. In 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game designer
            with Atari. Several months later he left the company to find
            spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and
            experimenting with psychedelic drugs.</q
